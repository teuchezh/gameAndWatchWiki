# Game & Watch Retro-Go Controls

Buttons are mapped as you would expect for each emulator. `GAME` is mapped to `START`, and `TIME` is mapped to `SELECT`. PAUSE/SET brings up the emulator menu.

By default, pressing the power-button while in a game will automatically trigger a save-state prior to putting the system to sleep. Note that this WILL overwrite the previous save-state for the current game.

## Macros

+ `PAUSE/SET` + `TIME` = Toggle speedup between 1x and the last non-1x speed. Defaults to 1.5x.
+ `PAUSE/SET` + `UP` = Brightness up.
+ `PAUSE/SET` + `DOWN` = Brightness down.
+ `PAUSE/SET` + `RIGHT` = Volume up.
+ `PAUSE/SET` + `LEFT` = Volume down.
+ `PAUSE/SET` + `B` = Load state.
+ `PAUSE/SET` + `A` = Save state.
+ `PAUSE/SET` + `POWER` = Poweroff WITHOUT save-stating.
